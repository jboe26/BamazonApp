# Getting Started

## I created an Amazon-like storefront with MYSQL and NodeJS that takes in orders from customers, and updates the quantity if something was sold.

### I used inquirer to ask the user for what they would like to purchase, and I installed a table for easy readability.

#### Please take a look around, and buy something!
